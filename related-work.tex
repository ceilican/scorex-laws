Verification and testing of software systems is an integral part of a software development lifecycle. Immediately after the implementation of the software, and before it's deployment, it has to be satisfactorily verified and tested to ensure that all the functional requirements have been properly met. On an average, it has been seen that 95-99\% of the total bugs in a software can be tackled if a proper testing methodology is utilised. Formal verification is one of the most popular methods of program verification. Formal verification is used to validate the correctness of a software module by modulating it's behaviour based on a set of formal methods, which are mathematical models specifying the intended functional behaviour. Though there are a lot of formal methods used for formal verification, and are selected based on the functional outlook of the software program, but the most common methods are the ones based on finite state machines, Petri Nets, process algebra and timed automata. Prior to formal verification, a mathematical model employing a formal method is decided upon which is then followed by a specification phase where the behaviour of the system is modelled, and finally the actual program is verified against this behaviour specification which is called the verification phase. In the late 90's, some optimisations were proposed to the otherwise conventional and inefficient exhaustive search methods [http://spinroot.com/spin/Doc/forte94a.pdf]. Write something about these optimizations and find some more past work.
