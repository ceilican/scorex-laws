\subsection{Scorex Framework}

The idea of a modular design for a cryptocurrency was first proposed by Goodman in Tezos whitepaper~\cite{goodmantezos}. The whitepaper~\footnote{Section 2 of the whitepaper} proposes to split a cryptocurrency design into the three protocols: network, transaction and consensus. In many cases, however, these layers are tightly coupled and it is hard to describe them separately. For example, in a proof-of-stake cryptocurrency a balance sheet structure, which is heavily influenced by a transaction structure, is used in a consensus protocol. To split a cryptocurrency design in more clear way, Scorex 2.0 has finer granularity.
