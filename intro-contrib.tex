\subsection{Our Contribution}

In this paper we report on the design and implementation of a suite of abstract property tests which are implemented in the Scorex framework to ease checking whether a blockchain client satisfies specified laws. A developer of a concrete blockchain system just needs to implement generators of random test inputs~(such as blocks and transactions), and then the testing system will extensively check properties against multiple input objects. We have implemented 59 property tests. We have integrated the tests into a prototype implementation of the TwinsCoin~\cite{cryptoeprint:2017:232} cryptocurrency, which has two types of blocks. \knote{enhance}
