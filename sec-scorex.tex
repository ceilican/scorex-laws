\section{Scorex Architecture}

Scorex is a framework for implementing blockchain clients. A client is a node in a peer-to-peer network. The node has a local view of the network state. The goal of the whole peer-to-peer system~\footnote{concretely, honest nodes of it. We skip notion of adversarial behavior further.} is to synchronize on a critical part of local views. Scorex is breaking node's local view into for following parts: 

\begin{itemize}
\item{history} contains log of persistent modifiers
\item{minimal state} is a structure enough to check an arbitrary persistent modifier
\item{vault} contains user-specific information
\item{memory pool} contains temporary objects to be packed into persistent modifiers 
\end{itemize}

The history and the minimal state are the parts of local views to be synchronized across the network. For this, nodes are running some consensus protocol to form a proper history, and the history should be resulted in a valid minimal state which is got by application of history elements to a pre-historical state.

The whole node view quadruple is to be changed atomically by applying whether a persistent node view modifier or an unconfirmed transaction. Scorex provides guarantees of atomicity and consistency for the application while a developer of a concrete system needs to provide implementations for the abstract parts of the quadruple as well as a family of persistent modifiers.

As an example, we consider a cryptocurrency Twinscoin, which consensus protocol is a combination of Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake. Scorex has a full-fledged Twinscoin implementation as an example of its usage. In TwinsCoin, there are two kinds of persistent modifiers, a Proof-of-Work block, and a Proof-of-Stake block.
