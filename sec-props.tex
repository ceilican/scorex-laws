\section{Blockchain properties}

In this section we provide our approach to generalized testing of abstract blockchain-like system design. For extensive testing we are  testing history, minimal state and memory pool separately, and also node view holder which updates the quadruple {\em <history, minimal state, vault, memory pool>} in an atomic way.
