\section{Blockchain properties}

In this section we provide our approach to generalized testing of abstract blockchain-like system design. For extensive testing we are  testing history, minimal state and memory pool separately, and also node view holder which updates the quadruple {\em <history, minimal state, vault, memory pool>} in an atomic way.


\subsection{Generators}

In our test suites we are using generators for objects we are using to check laws of a blockchain. A developer of a concrete system needs to implement these generators. We provide interfaces for generators of following types of objects:

\begin{itemize}
	\item{Syntactically valid, respectively, invalid modifier}
	\item{Semantically valid, respectively, invalid modifier}
	\item{Totally, so both semantically and syntactically, valid modifier. Respectively, a sequence of totally valid modifiers}
	\item{Transaction}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Forking}
