\section{Introduction}

A blockchain-based cryptocurrency is defined by a set of protocols, such as consensus protocol, , agreement on tokens emission rules, . A node, or a {\em client} is software implementation of the protocols. Even more, usually not all the details of all the protocols are specified, so there is some reference client implementation which defines behavior for other implementations. the notable exception here is Ethereum, which Yellow Paper (\knote{cite}) tries to define all the details of a client implementation. In Bitcoin, the reference implementation Bitcoin Core is considered to be standard, so an alternative implementation must reproduce its behavior, even bugs. (\knote{cite})

An error in a client implementation would be utterly costly and hard to fix. (\knote{examples}) On other hand, there is an increasing demand in developing more blockchain protocols and clients. 

Plenty of frameworks were proposed for speeding up development of new blockchains: \knote{list}. We have chosen Scorex \knote{why?}.

\subsection{Our Contribution}

In this paper we report on design and implementation of a suite of abstract property tests which are implemented for Scorex framework and checking laws of a blockchain client. A developer of a concrete blockchain system just needs to implement generators of random test inputs~(such as blocks and transactions), and then the testing system will extensively check properties against multiple input objects.
